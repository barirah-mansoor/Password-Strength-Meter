# Password-Strength-Meter
A password strength meter is a visual indicator that evaluates the security level of a password based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and unpredictability. It typically provides real-time feedback using color-coded bars or labels like "Weak," "Moderate," "Strong," or "Very Strong."
